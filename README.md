# Pi_Estimation_MATPOTLIB
To plot Monte Carlo simulation in Google Colab, you can use Python libraries like Matplotlib for visualization. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Google Colab typically comes with most libraries pre-installed, but you can run the following command to ensure Matplotlib is available:
2. Next, write your Monte Carlo simulation code. This might involve running a series of random simulations to estimate the behavior of a system. Here's a simple example of a Monte Carlo simulation for estimating Pi using random points:
3. Once you have your simulation results, you can use Matplotlib to visualize them. For example, you could plot the points generated in the simulation to illustrate the Monte Carlo method:
4. Finally, you can run this code in Google Colab. Make sure you're running each cell in order. You should see the plot generated by Matplotlib displaying the points generated by the Monte Carlo simulation.

That's it! You've plotted a Monte Carlo simulation in Google Colab using Matplotlib. You can adapt this approach to visualize other types of Monte Carlo simulations as well.
